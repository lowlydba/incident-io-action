## üìö Tutorial: Getting Started

Learn how to send your first alert to incident.io from a GitHub Actions
workflow.

### What You'll Need

1. An [incident.io](https://incident.io) account
1. A GitHub repository with Actions enabled
1. 10 minutes

### Step 1: Create an HTTP Alert Source

1. Log in to your incident.io dashboard
1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Alert Sources
1. Click [Create Alert Source][create-http] and select HTTP
1. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
1. Save and note the Alert Source Config ID and Token

### Step 2: Add Secrets to Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository
1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
1. Add two new repository secrets:
   - `INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN`: Your alert source token
   - `INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID`: Your alert source config ID

### Step 3: Create Your First Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/alert-on-failure.yml`:

```yaml
name: Alert on Failure
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Simulate failure
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Send alert to incident.io
        if: failure()
        uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
        with:
          incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
          alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
          title: 'Workflow Failed'
          status: 'firing'
          description: 'The main workflow has failed.'
```

### Step 4: Test It

1. Commit and push the workflow file
1. Watch the workflow run in the Actions tab
1. Check your incident.io dashboard for the alert

üéâ Congratulations! You've sent your first alert from GitHub Actions to
incident.io.

## üîß How-To Guides

Practical guides for common tasks.

### How to Alert on Deployment Failures

Monitor your deployment workflows and send alerts when they fail:

```yaml
name: Production Deploy
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ['Deploy to Production']
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  alert-on-failure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}
    steps:
      - name: Send deployment failure alert
        uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
        with:
          incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
          alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
          title: 'Production Deployment Failed'
          status: 'firing'
          description: |
            Deployment to production has failed.
            Workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.name }}
            Commit: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
```

### How to Add Custom Metadata

Enrich alerts with additional context using the `metadata` field:

```yaml
- name: Send alert with custom data
  uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
  with:
    incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
    alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
    title: 'High Error Rate Detected'
    status: 'firing'
    description: 'Error rate exceeded threshold'
    metadata: |
      {
        "service": "api",
        "environment": "production",
        "error_rate": "5.2%",
        "threshold": "1.0%",
        "region": "us-east-1"
      }
```

### How to Resolve Alerts Automatically

Send a "resolved" alert when an issue is fixed:

```yaml
- name: Send firing alert
  id: alert
  uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
  with:
    incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
    alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
    title: 'Service Degradation'
    status: 'firing'

- name: Wait for recovery
  run: sleep 60

- name: Resolve alert
  uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
  with:
    incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
    alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
    title: 'Service Recovered'
    status: 'resolved'
    deduplication-key: ${{ steps.alert.outputs.deduplication-key }}
```

### How to Use Custom Deduplication Keys

Control alert grouping with custom deduplication keys:

```yaml
- name: Send alert with custom key
  uses: lowlydba/incident-io-action@v1
  with:
    incident-io-token: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_TOKEN }}
    alert-source-config-id: ${{ secrets.INCIDENT_IO_ALERT_SOURCE_ID }}
    title: 'Database Migration Failed'
    status: 'firing'
    deduplication-key: 'db-migration-${{ github.run_id }}'
```

## üí° Explanation

### Why Use This Action?

Problem: When CI/CD pipelines fail, teams need immediate visibility into the
failure to respond quickly. While GitHub provides notifications, integrating
with a dedicated incident management platform like incident.io provides better
context, tracking, and collaboration.

Solution: This action bridges GitHub Actions and incident.io, automatically
creating alerts enriched with workflow context, enabling teams to:

- üéØ Centralize incident tracking and alert notifications across multiple systems
- üì¢ Leverage incident.io's escalation and on-call features
- üìã Maintain a single source of truth for incidents
- üîó Correlate CI/CD failures with other system alerts

### How Alert Deduplication Works

The action uses deduplication keys to group related alerts together. By default,
each workflow run gets a unique key based on the GitHub run ID, preventing
duplicate alerts for the same run.

Default behavior: Each workflow run creates a new alert

```text
Workflow Run #123 ‚Üí Alert with key "123"
Workflow Run #124 ‚Üí Alert with key "124"
```

Custom keys: Use the same key to update an existing alert

```text
Firing alert ‚Üí deduplication-key: "db-migration-prod"
Resolved alert ‚Üí deduplication-key: "db-migration-prod" (updates same alert)
```

### Alert Status Lifecycle

Alerts in incident.io follow a lifecycle:

1. Firing: An active issue that needs attention
1. Resolved: The issue has been fixed

This action supports both statuses, allowing you to:

- üö® Create alerts when problems are detected (`status: firing`)
- ‚úÖ Automatically resolve them when fixed (`status: resolved`)

### GitHub Context Enrichment

The action automatically adds GitHub-specific metadata to every alert. This
provides immediate context about:

- üìä What happened: Workflow name and job
- üìç Where it happened: Repository, branch, commit
- üë§ Who triggered it: Actor who initiated the workflow
- ‚è∞ When it happened: Run number and attempt

This enrichment happens automatically and is merged with any custom metadata you
provide, ensuring you never lose important context.

### Design Decisions

> Why require alert-source-config-id?

Each alert source in incident.io has unique routing, escalation, and grouping
rules. Requiring this ID ensures alerts reach the correct team and follow the
appropriate response procedures.

> Why default to workflow run ID for deduplication?

Most use cases involve alerting on individual workflow failures. Using the run
ID as a default prevents alert noise while still allowing customization for
advanced scenarios.

> Why automatically include GitHub context?

Manual context gathering is error-prone and tedious. Automatic enrichment
ensures consistent, comprehensive information in every alert, improving response
times and debugging.
